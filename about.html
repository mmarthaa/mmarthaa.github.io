<h1>About Me</h1><p>One thing that has always surrounded me was art. I have always had an inclination to creating work 
that engages the viewer and questions their ethics. I started when I was about 7, and 
now I am 23 with a strong passion to continue making art. My medium of choice is photography. 
The more conceptual the better, is what I always strive for. When I am creating work, I always
put pieces of myself in it. My work is very personal to me, so each photograph is essentially a
small window into who I am as a person. </p>
