<h1>About Me</h1><p>One thing that has always surrounded me was art. <br>
I have always had an inclination to creating work that engages the viewer and questions their ethics. <br>
I started when I was about 7, and now I am 23 with a strong passion to continue making art.<br> 
My medium of choice is photography. <br>
The more conceptual the better, is what I always strive for. When I am creating work, I always put pieces of myself in it.<br>
My work is very personal to me, so each photograph is essentially a small window into who I am as a person. </p>
